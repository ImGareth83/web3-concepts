# Solidity Projects

This repository contains projects from my Alchemy Learning journey, focusing on Ethereum cryptography and blockchain development.

## Projects

### 1. Cryptography

Ethereum cryptography utilities for message hashing, signing, and key recovery.

**Features:**
- Message hashing using Keccak-256
- Message signing with private keys
- Key recovery from signatures
- Address generation from public keys

**Files:**
- `hashMessage.js` - Hash messages using Keccak-256
- `signMessage.js` - Sign messages with private keys
- `recoverKey.js` - Recover public keys from signatures
- `getAddress.js` - Generate Ethereum addresses from public keys
- `test.js` - Test suite for all utilities

**Usage:**
```bash
cd cryptography
npm install
npm test
```

### 2. Find Colours

A utility to find the original color from a hash value. Given a hash, it determines which color (from a predefined set) produced that hash.

**Features:**
- Hash color values using SHA-256
- Reverse lookup to find the original color from a hash
- Supports colors: red, green, blue, yellow, pink, orange

**Files:**
- `index.js` - Main function to find colors from hashes
- `test.js` - Test suite for color finding functionality

**Usage:**
```bash
cd find_colours
npm install
npm test
```
